## Project Overview
This project aims to perform clustering analysis to identify distinct patterns of VR usage and associated learning behaviors among students with varying demographic profiles. The goal is to create student clusters based on:
- VR engagement levels
- Hours of usage
- Perceived creativity
- Stress levels

### Research Questions
1. How many different types of VR learners can we find by analyzing their interaction with VR?
2. Which clustering method provides the most stable and interpretable groups when validated across regions?
3. What are the key distinguishing features between high-performing and low-performing clusters?
4. How do cluster characteristics vary across different regional and support system contexts?
5. How do engagement levels in VR correlate with academic outcomes within each identified cluster?

### Dataset Information
- **Source**: [Kaggle - Impact of Virtual Reality on Education](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/waqi786/impact-of-virtual-reality-on-education/data)
- **Description**: The dataset contains information on students' VR usage patterns, engagement levels, demographic details, and academic outcomes.

### Repository Structure
- **`data/`**: Contains the original and processed datasets.
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks for EDA, feature engineering, and clustering analysis.
- **`scripts/`**: Python scripts for data cleaning, feature engineering, and clustering.
- **`reports/`**: Interim and final reports.
- **`figures/`**: Visualizations generated during the analysis.

### How to Run the Project
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shabnamRafat/DataMining_FinalProject_Team-1.git
    ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
    - Create a virtual environment:
      ```bash
      python -m venv
      source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
      ```
    - Install required Python libraries:
      ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```
3. **Jupyter Notebook Usage**:
    - Navigate to the `notebooks` folder and start Jupyter Notebook:
      ```bash
      jupyter notebook
      ```
