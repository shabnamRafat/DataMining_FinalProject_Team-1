# Contribution Guidelines

## Branching Strategy
- **`main`**: Only stable and complete code goes here.
- **Feature Branches**: Create branches for specific features or tasks:
  - `eda`: All exploratory data analysis work.
  - `feature-engineering`: All code related to feature engineering.
  - `modeling`: Code for clustering analysis and model building.
  - `report-writing`: Final write-up progress.

## Commit Messages
Please use meaningful commit messages. Examples:
- `"Added initial EDA with histograms and correlations"`
- `"Cleaned data and handled missing values"`

## Pull Requests
- Create pull requests to merge your feature branch into `main`.
- Ensure your code is properly documented and runs without errors before submitting a pull request.
- Include a summary of changes and any relevant issues that were addressed.
